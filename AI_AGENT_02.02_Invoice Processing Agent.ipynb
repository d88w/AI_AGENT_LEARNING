The system will use the LLM’s capabilities to understand invoice content while maintaining strict data consistency through a fixed schema.\n","\n","First, let’s create our specialized invoice extraction tool:\n","\n","Our agent includes two specialized tools that integrate to manage the invoice processing workflow:\n","\n","1. The first tool, extract_invoice_data, acts as our intelligent document analyzer. This function uses self-prompting to take raw document text and transform it into structured data following a consistent schema. It uses a prompt that guides the LLM to identify crucial invoice elements like invoice numbers, dates, and line items. By enforcing a fixed JSON schema with required fields, the tool ensures data consistency regardless of the original invoice format. It is still possible that the LLM may hallucinate, so other techniques could be needed for a production use case, but this demonstrates the basic functionality.\n","\n","2. The second tool, store_invoice, provides a simple persistence mechanism in a dictionary. Once an invoice has been properly extracted and structured, this function saves it to our invoice database, using the invoice number as a unique identifier. The invoices are stored separate from the memory so that they can be persisted across runs of the agent."],"metadata":{"id":"_zvyWddrJ9RH"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"scCP-7_3JnUn"},"outputs":[],"source":["@register_tool(tags=[\"document_processing\", \"invoices\"])\n","def extract_invoice_data(action_context: ActionContext, document_text: str) -> dict:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Extract standardized invoice data from document text.\n","\n","    This tool ensures consistent extraction of invoice information by using a fixed schema\n","    and specialized prompting for invoice understanding.
