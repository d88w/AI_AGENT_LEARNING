Also, we don’t need a special format for the rules, the human-readable policy becomes the logic!\n","\n","First, let’s assume that the purchasing rules are stored in a simple **text file** located at `\"config/purchasing_rules.txt\"`.

There are situations where the results of an evaluation need to be captured in a format that other systems can work with. If an organization wants to log purchasing violations in a database, trigger automated workflows based on compliance status, or generate structured reports on spending patterns, then a loosely written explanation from an LLM—however insightful—won’t be enough. The output needs to follow a predictable structure so that it can be systematically processed.\n","\n","To make this possible, we can shift from a purely natural language response to a structured JSON format. Instead of returning an open-ended explanation, we direct the LLM to produce a response that includes two key elements: a boolean flag that indicates whether the invoice is compliant (`true` or `false`), and a structured field that provides a justification for the decision. By using `prompt_llm_for_json`, we ensure that the response conforms to this expected format, eliminating ambiguity and making it easy to integrate with downstream systems.\n","\n","The modification to our validation tool is straightforward. Instead of returning a free-text analysis, we define a schema that enforces the structured response. The expert tool reads the purchasing rules from disk, provides those rules as context to the LLM, and requests a JSON-formatted response that aligns with the schema."],"metadata":{"id":"dkYxd7RAe1qU"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["@register_tool(tags=[\"invoice_processing\", \"validation\"])\n","def check_purchasing_rules(action_context: ActionContext, invoice_data: dict) -> dict:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Validate an invoice against company purchasing policies, returning a structured response.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        invoice_data: Extracted invoice details, including vendor, amount, and line items.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        A structured JSON response indicating whether the invoice is compliant and why.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    rules_path = \"config/purchasing_rules.txt\"\n","\n","    try:\n","        with open(rules_path, \"r\") as f:\n","            purchasing_rules = f.read()\n","    except FileNotFoundError:\n","        purchasing_rules = \"No rules available.
