Even if an agent makes the right decision with the information it has, external circumstances might change that make an action undesirable after it’s taken. Reversible actions provide a safety net, allowing us to “undo” operations when things go wrong.\n","\n","The key to making actions reversible is capturing enough information during the execution to fully reverse the operation later. This isn’t always straightforward - for example, deleting a calendar event is easy to reverse if you saved all the event details, but reversing an email that’s already been read requires careful thought about what “reversal” means in your system. Sometimes, the best we can do is send a follow-up correction.\n","\n","Let’s examine how we might structure actions so they can be undone:"],"metadata":{"id":"L6CAB6AQjULT"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"TZd6NovKjLnY"},"outputs":[],"source":["class ReversibleAction:\n","    def __init__(self, execute_func, reverse_func):\n","        self.execute = execute_func\n","        self.reverse = reverse_func\n","        self.execution_record = None\n","\n","    def run(self, **args):\n","        \"\"\"Execute action and record how to reverse it.\"\"\"\n","        result = self.execute(**args)\n","        self.execution_record = {\n","            \"args\": args,\n","            \"result\": result,\n","            \"timestamp\": datetime.now().isoformat()\n","        }\n","        return result\n","\n","    def undo(self):\n","        \"\"\"Reverse the action using recorded information.\"\"\"\n","        if not self.execution_record:\n","            raise ValueError(\"No action to reverse\")\n","        return self.reverse(**self.execution_record)\n","\n","# Example using reversible actions\n","create_event = ReversibleAction(\n","    execute_func=calendar.create_event,\n","    reverse_func=lambda **record: calendar.delete_event(record[\"result\"][\"event_id\"])\n",")\n","\n","send_invite = ReversibleAction(\n","    execute_func=calendar.send_invite,\n","    reverse_func=lambda **record: calendar.cancel_invite(record[\"result\"][\"invite_id\"])\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Now, if we record a log of the agent’s actions, we can undo them if needed.

For example, scheduling a meeting might involve checking availability, creating a calendar event, and sending notifications. Transaction management lets us treat these related actions as a single unit that either completely succeeds or completely fails.\n","\n","The transaction pattern becomes particularly powerful when combined with reversible actions. If any step in a multi-step process fails, we can automatically roll back all previous steps. This prevents inconsistent states where, for example, a calendar event exists but notifications weren’t sent, or notifications were sent but the event wasn’t created.
