This pattern is helpful for supporting dependency injection and decoupling tools from the agent and other dependencies. Let’s explore how the action_context pattern works and why it’s valuable for building flexible and maintainable agent architectures.\n","\n","Let’s take a look at an example of why we need dependency injection and how the action_context pattern can help. Consider building an AI agent that helps develop and review code. In a typical workflow, the agent first acts as an expert developer to write code based on requirements. Later, we want the agent to switch roles and act as a code reviewer, critiquing its own work. This seems straightforward at first, but it surfaces a crucial architectural challenge.\n","\n","For the code review to be effective, the LLM needs to understand the full context of how the code was developed. What requirements were specified? What constraints were discussed? What alternatives were considered and rejected?\n","\n","Let’s assume that all of this information exists in the conversation history stored in the agent’s memory. What we would like to do is allow the LLM to see the memory of what happened in the agent loop, which contains a history of the code generation and requirements, and use it to provide a more informed code review.
