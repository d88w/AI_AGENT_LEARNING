Be careful not to over-whip.\n","   - Gently fold the whipped cream into the slightly cooled egg mixture.\n","   - Add the mascarpone cheese to the mixture, folding it in until smooth and creamy.

This allows the flavors to meld and the dessert to set properly.\n","   - Before serving, dust the top with unsweetened cocoa powder and add chocolate shavings or curls if desired.\n","   \n","Enjoy your homemade tiramisu!
